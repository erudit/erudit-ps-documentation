    <p>In the face of the failure of the transmission argument Wright would, apparently, endorse the view that Caution could still provide an adequate route to an anti-realist account of necessity, as can be gathered from the following passage:</p>
    <p>
        <disp-quote>
            <p>We suppose (i) that a priori judgement will play a part in the operation of any coherent system of belief, and (ii) that non-cognitivism about necessity had probably better grant a role for judgements of necessity as co-ordinate to (some) a priori judgements. If supposition (i) is wrong, then global Caution about necessitated judgements is, after all, at the service of the non-cognitivist about necessity</p>
        </disp-quote>
    </p>
    <p>I disagree. In the previous section we saw that showing that Caution is an incoherent attitude is not an easy matter.</p>
